# Digital Doll Core (NestJS Project)

This repository serves as the core backend for a **Digital Doll** platform, built using the **NestJS** framework. The project is designed to operate as a **microservice-based architecture**, providing modularity, scalability, and flexibility for future enhancements.

---

## Overview

This project is currently **under development** and forms the backbone of the Digital Doll system. It features a set of **microservices** that handle distinct responsibilities while communicating through **Kafka** as the message broker. The system is being designed for seamless **containerization with Docker**, ensuring portability and easier deployment.

---

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: Enables modular and independent development of core components.
- **Kafka Integration**: Facilitates communication between services using a reliable message broker.
- **Scalability**: Built with scalability in mind to handle increasing user demands.
- **NestJS Framework**: Provides a robust and maintainable foundation for backend services.

---

## Microservices

### 1. **API Service**
- Handles common endpoint management and acts as the entry point for external interactions.
- To run:
  ```bash
  npm run start:dev api
  ```

### 2. **ChatGPT Service**
- Manages AI interactions and communication through GPT-based solutions.
- To run:
  ```bash
  npm run start:dev chatgpt
  ```

### 3. **Auth Service**
- Manages user authentication and authorization using `TypeORM` and PostgreSQL.
- To run:
  ```bash
  npm run start:dev auth
  ```

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **Nest CLI** (for development convenience)
- **Docker** (for containerization in production)
- **Kafka** (set up as the message broker)
- **PostgreSQL** (for database management)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables for each service. Create `.env` files in their respective directories with the necessary configurations.

4. Start the required services (API, ChatGPT, and Auth) in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev <service-name>
   ```

---

## Dockerization (Planned)

The project is being structured for **Docker support**, which will streamline deployment and scaling. A `docker-compose.yml` file will be added to handle multi-container setups for the microservices, Kafka, and PostgreSQL.

---

## Future Plans

- Add more microservices for enhanced functionality.
- Implement monitoring and logging for better observability.
- Finalize and document the Docker containerization process.
- Expand Kafka integration for more robust inter-service communication.
